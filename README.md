PhotoTagManager
===============

Manages photos by assigning tags to them

Main goals are:

1. provide a high quality world-class software
2. manage photos by quick importing them on local machine, assighning tags to them
3. finding photos by tags, dates, etc and managing them as a group 
   (sharing, backing them up, copying to photo-print services and so on)
   
Typical use-case:

I have new photos & little time to work with them.
I connect camera to PC and want my photos to be copied to my storage, to subfolder according mask YYYY-MM
I want those photos to be marked as "Museum", "Cool&Fun", "Travels"
Later, when I want to print them, I want to find them all 
by a tag "Museum" and send them to printing service or just to removable drive

Of course, I want to have easy navigation and preview of images.

Not-Invented-Here disclaimer:
I know some already existing applications with similar capabilities.
Those that free are awful. Those that are not - nice, but not free.
I have to made application of my dream. I hope for help from open-source society.
